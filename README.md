# Robert Lanzafame CV

This repo contains my CV and uses GitHub Pages to host it as a website, as well as create and share a PDF version. Both are readable, but work needs to be done on the formatting.

This is also my first attempt at using MyST Markdown. I am using it as a way to learn about the ecosystem and to give feedback and contributions back to the jupyterbook community. To this end, I created a separate repo [github.com/rlanzafame/sandbox-mystmd-CV](https://github.com/rlanzafame/sandbox-mystmd-CV) for exploring bugs and experiments and to invite PR's and others to do the same.

Hartelijk bedankt to Freek Pols for encouraging me to do this and for sharing [Norbert van Veen's CV](https://github.com/NorbertvanVeen/CurriculumVitae), which I modified to create this one.

My work in this repository is shared under CC BY, although note that code is included from others and I might not have the README up to date all the time.
