# Robert Lanzafame CV

This repo contains my CV and uses GitHub Pages to host it as a website, as well as create and share a PDF version. Both are readable, but work needs to be done on the formatting.

This is also my first attempt at using MyST Markdown. I am using it as a way to learn about the ecosystem and to give feedback and contributions back to the jupyterbook community.

Hartelijk bedankt to Freek Pols for encouraging me to do this and for sharing [Norbert van Veen's CV](https://github.com/NorbertvanVeen/CurriculumVitae), which I modified to create this one.

My work in this repository is shared under CC BY, although note that code is included from others and I might not have the README up to date all the time.
